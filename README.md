# jmgloria07 At Github Pages -- My online CV

Basically a fork from robhinds/robhinds.github.io. Please check his repository for technical details.

I'm working in the IT, I thought it's relevant to put our CVs online. And luckily I found a template for me to start with (thanks mister robhinds).

This is a fully static webpage that utilizes Jekyll, a platform to generate fast and simple pages, which pretty much what I needed for this to work.

In the future I might expound this and a blog section hosted at the same repository/domain.
